# Final-Project-AI
The project consisted of gathering wine data from the UCI Wine Quality Data Set. It had to do with the classification of wine quality based on metrics seen inside the dataset. After using PyCaret, a conclusion can be driven that Extra Trees and Random forest are the best models for this use case / data. With a performance of 80% for both models on the test set, they delivered predictions with decent accuracy.
